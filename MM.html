        <p>Would our colleagues be willing to use <span class="bold">MM</span>  to communicate?</p>

        <li><span class="hightlight">Fast & easy</span> to use ;</li>

        <p><span class="bold">Phase I: Speed! Speed! Speed!</span></p>
        <p>Firstly, we quickly built and released a primary chat feature when we made sure the basic need instead of carrying on the user research, because we decided <span class="bold">let it BE USED as soon as possible</span>. Just as planned, our colleagues responded lots of feedback (subjective opinions, behaviours) when they were <span class="bold">aroused</span>, and based on these prioritised feedback, we started countless iterations including implementation and validation.</p>

        <p>When our colleagues identified MM as a enterprise tool when chatting, they gave us deeper information when we inquired them because of more diverse scenarios and their <span class="bold">reflection</span>. In this phase, we tried to let them feel <span class="bold">"WOW! MM is alive!"</span> by fortnightly releasing features that they desired.</p>
        <p>The process was like:</p>
      	<ul class="list-c disc">
      		<li>Prioritize all the opinions which each member have already understand stories.</li>
      		<li>Consider man-day and assign story point together.</li>

          <p>Based on our early insights, we found that the most upsetting flaw of SK**E was <span class="bold">"hard to find messages."</span> Besides, lots of users have already been familiar with the mental model of <span class="bold">how to chat</span>: <span class="bold">Quickly start to chat</span> without send him an invitation as long as you find the colleague in your contact.</p><p>Our beta version focused on deliverying a service that is simple and easily to access your messages you want.</p>

          <p>We often folded down the corner of a book page, which is called <span class="bold">DOGEAR</span>. I connect the filter feature with this intuitive behaviour so that user can easily fold down any message what they want to tag, and, by one click, all the folded message will be display at once.</p>

      <p>Quickly user testing before implement. As you can see in fig.7, before coding, one of the paper prototype (screenshot) that I visualized rapidely by sketch, and I recruited some colleagues, let them try to interacte with it.

        <li>Before the participant flips over the next step, he or she needs to express his or her anticipation.</li>
        <li>Mark the key step which makes them feel surprise or shock.</li>
        <li>Interview the participant after he or she completes the task.</li>

      <span class="sub-t">Based on the FACT</span>      
      <p>MM dashboard shows tons of records we want to detect. In the Fig.8 below, there are some general data such as login log and the count of message by predefined rules. We also check and find the changes when after a new feature released.</p>

        <li>Realize what kind of UI layout should we concern when designing more features in the future.</li>

      <p>I recruited 5 participants and invited them to complete a task: Create a Poll and vote it (as you can see in Fig. 9.) The results indicated that:</p>
      <ul class="list-c disc">
        <li>All of 5 participants complete the task smoothly. Besides, from the TFF (Time to First Fixation) shown in Fig.11, participants found the <span class="bold">Key Button</span>: the entry of creating a Poll quite quickly.</li>
        <li>When performing the task we gave, participants were attracted by the left dark background naturally in the screen even there wasn't any visual elements relating to the whole task, actually.</li>
