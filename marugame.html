      <h4 class="uppercase">Background</h4> 
      <p class="M2k-description">Marugame Seimen (TORIDOLL), the well known chain store in Japan, released a mobile ordering service in early 2020. Based on the O:der Pick-up Plaftform, users can order and set a pick up time ahead to save the time and skip the queues, especially during the pandemic of Covid-19. 
      However, when the clients kept rolling out new combo menus to meet customers’ needs, the current version became cluttered and unfriendly, because O:der Pick-up Platform provided a general ordering UI, but not a optimal one.</p>

      <h4 class="uppercase">Research</h4>
          <p>In the early stage of this project, the specific requirement about UI from our client was: Improve the experience of ordering a Combo menu.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, there were some existing and realistc issues on the current system: the technology was quite outedated, and Marugame Seimen should isolate from the pick-up platform to relieve the effort from our customer service team as well.</p>
          <p>Based on those known issues, it was an opportunity to review and improve the current service, and it was worth establishing a new benchmark as well for any further plan, such as iteratively enhancement by data-driven process, because the active users might be huge.</p>
          <p>After some discussions with PM, engineers, customer support members, we tended to make an overhall rather than just an incremental change, and planed to sync with our clien to seek an understanding.</p>

      <p>How will users choose their first menu?</p>
      <ul class="udon-top-list">
        <li>With a pre-determined goal:
          <ol class="udon-top-list-step italic">
            <li>Quickly scan and recognize what the interface and elements mean</li>
            <li>Find the relative section</li>
            <li>Scroll and look around the target</li>
            <li>Focus on images, then check the name of menu</li>
            <li>Find and confirm the target item</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Seek some inspiration:
          <ol class="udon-top-list-step italic">
            <li>Explore from top to bottom of the menu to gain the informaiton</li>
            <li>At the same time, some of the items that catched his/her eyes during scrolling down</li>
            <li>Compare and make a decision</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Based on user's behavior and mindset, I came up with some concepts that might support both two kinds of users to complete their task more efficiently:</p>
      <p class="bold">Provide essential and noticeable informaiton within the first-view as possible as we can</p>
         <p class="udon-list-description">Menu informaton is what users desire to gain when they enter this page.</p>
         <p class="udon-list-description">"How long should I wait?" should noticeable and display in the early stage of whole task instead of placing in the later step.</p>
      <p class="bold">Make a menu list that ease to browse and manipulate</p>
        <p class="udon-list-description">The interface can lead users find and compare target items easily.</p>

      <p><span class="jp">気付き・理解・操作しやいインターフェース</span></p>
      <p>When users enter the menu detail page, they often quickly scan the image and name (even description) for just a little bit more comfirmation. The main purpose and task would be understanding how to order if there are some options, changing the quantity. After confirming the price, they will expect that there is a clear accessable way to bring them to go forward. That is the CTA of this page: add to cart.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Make CTA always be displayed near the eye gazing path.</span> To prevent users from getting confused when they are trying to go forward.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Strengthen the role of navigation element more intuitive.</span>With placing a little left arrow at the left of the link which labelled ”お品書き画面へ”, the motivation of "back to menu list" is quickly connected to the action.</p>

      <p>Setting a proper pickup time is rather important on this service because it represents a sign of when should start to prepare the meal and the deadline of the preparation task. During the usability testing, I found that almost of the participants didn't change the pickup time. Here were some reasons from them:</p>
      <ul class="udon-payment-list italic">
        <li>I did check the pickup time, and the default pickup time is good for me.</li>
        <li>Oh, actually I didn't read it, I mean, I've never been aware of the pickup time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I could be an crucial problem that caused they place an order that they can't pickup on time actually or an unitended pickup time.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Noticeable and clear pickup time information.</span> By giving a particular visual weight of pickup time information and emphasizing the "The earliest estimated pickup time" by red color, I orginaized a new layout which would be ease to focus on and ease to 
      understand the current state and make a decision.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Predictable and less cogonitive load.</span> State the rule clearly and display the supporting text underneath the input rather than as a placeholder to avoid memorizing.</p>

      <p>I've learned from the previous user research that users tended to omit some copies and respond quickly depending on if their mental model was strong enough or not. That means it could be more concise and help users focus on the content. However, sometimes users will feel slightly confused even if they knew there was only one way to go forward. And I solved this kind of problems by conducting several user testing to discover their mental model. 
      <p><span class="bold">Concise and communicative copy.</span> Tell users the only important things with visual weight.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Action-oriented copy.</span> Trigger users' motivation and emotion by specific object and navigate users to where they should go with predictable words.</p>

      <h4 class="uppercase">Evaluate</h4>
      <p>Since the primary goal of this project was improve the efficiency of the existing ordering experience. Does it work? I conducted an evaluation both on the redesign and the old one to compare the efficiency, which includes:</p>
      <p><span class="bold">How much time would be saved while ordering on the redesign?</span> How fast will users complete the ordering task compare with the current version?</p>
      <p>To answer the question above, I ran a summative usability testing both on existing one and the redesign.</p>

          <ol class="udon-top-list-step circle">
            <li>Usability testing</li>
            <li>Within-subject design (all of the participants went through the task on new and old one but with different order: half of participants went from new to old, while the others went the opposite order) </li>

            <li>Average time on task1: Redesign: 55 sec. The Old site: 78 sec. </li>
            <li>100% of participants complete the task1 on the redersign faster than on the old one (even most of them have piror experience on the old site)　</li>
            <li>Accuracy*: Redesign→ Level3: 100%; the old site→ Level3: 23%, Level2: 53%, Level1: 23%</li>
