      <h3>“ Another way to <span class="hightlight">access your attachments</span> more efficiently in Mail2000. ”</h3>
      <p>Sometimes, it’s rather annoyed by how to find your messages or attachment in your Email because your mail would get more and more complex as time goes on.  Since Mail2000 users always check mails and files in an 8-hour workday, we provided a simpler way for them to access attachments in Mail2000. We expect not only to improve the proficiency of finding attachment, but to increase the productivity of work. </p>

        <p><span class="bold">Lead everyone to realize our user. </span>I conducted several interview for collecting data of users' behaviours and their context and presented to every partner to make sure all of us had an identical domain knowledge toward the target user before we started to make any solution.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Verify and Refinement. </span>Since the member of this project was rahter simple, I recommended a method of usability (called RITE), we conducted a series of intensive usability testing to determine how target users interact with FileView when the development phase began. I used several shorter circles and recruited participants to help us find and verify problems. In addition, I also help some front-end job, such as modified the style (CSS) of FileView UI during the development phase.</p>

        <p>To strengthen ours domain knowledge of Mail2000, we conducted a series of In-depth interviews among 10 Mail2000 users (9 Taiwanese in A company and 1 Japanese in B company) to find out about their context. </p>
        <p>"We focues on obeserving users' behaviour at first becouse that would help us get more cues based on facts quickly, then extended to their scenarios inclusive of many objects or interactions, finally, their attitudes toward whole Mail2000."</p>

        <p>Except for composing and reading mail, while using Mail2000 (webmail) in PC, these users always “manage their mail folder” (to put the right mail into the right folder) and “find”. We hightlighted some common attributes of what we learned from them:
        </p>
        <p><span class="bold">Behaviour</span></p>
        <ul class="list-c disc">
          <li>Always communicating with external contact every workday.</li>
          <li>Categorise their mail into To-do or DONE in many ways, and precisely classify their mail. (by project, person, team, and so on)</li>
          <li>They download attachment either when going to edit current file immediately, or concerning that preview might show a distort document.</li>
          <li>Heaps of mails. Because they never delete their mails. (except for spam)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="bold">Attitude</span></p>
        <ul class="list-c disc">
          <li>Mail2000 is the only place where always keeping theirs the purest and newest attachment, especially when they found nothing in local folders.</li>
          <li>Categorise their mail into To-do or DONE in many ways, and precisely classify their mail. (by project, person, team, and so on)</li>
          <li>Occasionally, it’s quite hard to find mails out for them, especially attachment, and not just concerns of performance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In order to realize the context of searching thoroughly, I conducted a brief one-on-one usability testing with think aloud method among 7 participants.</p>

        <p>We found there are two patterns of behaviour:</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Recall and type keyword. </span>Two partipants even couldn’t sure if they received this mail before, so they tried some keywords first. (green line)</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Exploring. </span>Five of them knew that mail, the goal became simpler for them: Shift into the right folder (their context looks , just changing viewing mode. (blue line)</p>
        <p>The fact is, it’s quite hard for participants to type even one keyword to search for lacking of retrieval cues, on the other hand, it tends to make participants losing their way when catching the wrong memory at the beginning.</p>

        <p>In order to answer this question, I must to realize how users finds their attachments. I implemented lots of usability testing with different complexity of the target. We found there were several cues when retrieving, and the name of attachment is the most difficult cue to recall because of variable.</p> 
        <p>There are two path of context I've mentioned above, if user remember any cue they type keyword then they started to search, but inevitably get annoyed due to they must to visit each mail with attachment; in the other hands, if the memory is vague, they could even go to a wrong SERP, let alone find an attachment.</p>
