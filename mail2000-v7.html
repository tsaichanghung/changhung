      <p class="M2k-description">Mail2000 V7 was a major UI/UX overhaul in 2014. Mail2000 is a well-known Email service for enterprise in Taiwan (called Cybermail in Japan), and our goal in this overhaul was to create a more fresh look that could easily grow and develop with our current and future customers, and deliver more usable features for them.</p>

        <p>For me, the sole designer on this project at the timeit, it was a big challenge: How could I realize the user and know what’s the goal of the UI overhaul as soon as possible?</p> 
        <p>For users, of course, no one likes change -  <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/fresh-vs-familiar-aggressive-redesign/">Fresh vs. Familiar: How Aggressively to Redesign.</a> Because users are concerned that they have to learn the system again and it’ll take time to accustom themselves to the change.</p> <p>The worst case would be: We spend a lot of time bring a brand new UI but user feel upset and we lose part of them finally. In order to reduce any reprisal (such as user revolt) as possible as we could,</p> 
        <p><span class="bold">Make things clear.</span> First, I made a list that including two main parts: 1. UI flaws in V6; 2. User Wish Pool in V7 after research. Then, illustrate the insight of these users including their needs and ideas. Meanwhile, I analysed what user desired and their attitudes.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Gain support.</span> In order to share our concept of V7 and gain acceptance from involved members, I partnered with PM, starting to visualize our ideas quickly and draw an overview of what these features like, then, we defined the scope of redesign together.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Invite internal end-user to evaluate. </span>Depending on different purposes in each stage, I created lots of prototype in order to conduct several usability testings to improve V7 before the formal release.</p>

        <p>I decided to <span class="bold">let something happen</span> when users are interacting with V6 and observe it, thus, I particularly chose two features which were used very frequently: “Compose” and “Mail management” and conducted usability testing (with think aloud) among three novice users: no experience of V6 but has experience using others and three expert users: three years experience, we found out:</p>
        <ul class="list-c disc">
          <li><span class="bold">The different kinds of mental model between Novice and Expert user.</span> when typing sender, the interaction of autocomplete was obscure, not every action could use keyboard, such as delete unwanted sender; besides, it's hard for novice to distinguish the difference between indicated icon and clickable button.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Error times is related to skill.</span> The Novices usually slip when dragging files into a specified area to attach files.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Lack of feedback.</span> All of these partipents don't understand has system responded the request or not. They spent redundant time double-checking if the request has been done or not frequently. </li>

        <p>The Expert User (totally get used to V6) has their own path to deal with daily task. But they probably didn’t remember the name of the feature, <span class="bold">(somewhat like we probably can’t answer the name of the street in our hometown but we never get lost.)</span> That means, they’ve already accustomed to the <a  target="blank" href="https://uxmag.com/articles/the-secret-to-designing-an-intuitive-user-experience">conceptual model</span></a> of V6, while novices, in contrast, no matter what task they faced, the performance and satisfaction were not very well, even though they spent time confused as what to do, inevitably, they failed after they done.</p>

              <li>Comparing the Send button, V7 is in the bottom of the compose page but in V6, the SEND button was in the top. (Although there was another one in the bottom, and hard to be found.) The fact is, nobody failed in compose, but some of them felt unfamiliar. In the other words, their perfomence of the task "Send a mail" was good, but their satisfaction toward the position wasn't. Now that "Mastery" is an indicator we've got from research, so we decided to make it as one of user-level preference. (And defualt is in the bottom.) </li>

      <h4 class="uppercase">What I learned</h4>        
        <p>After 7 months of develpment, we finally released V7 and on July 14 2015, we had the first updated customer in Taiwan, and the first new customer in Japan after 6 months.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, we are serving over more than 200 enterprise (64,813U in Japan, more than 1,000 domains in Taiwan and China, they are stably using the Mail2000 V7.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Do not try to test customer tolerance.</span> Before starting on design, make sure what on earth do users' wants and desires. In our case, a fancy UI with animation dosen't matter to our users. Performance, Simple, Effective mattered that most.</p>
